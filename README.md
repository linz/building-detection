Pipeline for training computer vision models based on [Raster Vision](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision).

### Purpose
This initial pipeline focuses on training models to extract buildings from imagery. This project is also an opportunity to evaluate Raster Vision for the extraction of geo-spatial features from imagery in general and can be expanded to other feature types.
