Pipeline for training computer vision models based on [Raster Vision](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision).

## Purpose
This initial pipeline focuses on training models to extract buildings from imagery. This project is also an opportunity 
to evaluate Raster Vision for the extraction of geo-spatial features from imagery in general and can be expanded to other feature types.

## Running locally

### Setup

* Build the Docker image using `docker/build`.
* Set any environment variables needed by `docker/run`, which you can read about by running `docker/run --help`.
